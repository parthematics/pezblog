## _pezblog_ 
#### the blog you've always missed

_pezblog_ was inspired by the feel of blogs/personal websites from the early 2000s. Nowadays, it's hard to get the same raw feeling from writing on a Substack or Wordpress site. Treat yourself to something better.

### Getting started
Getting started is as easy as signing up for an account [here]([url](https://pezblog.vercel.app/signup)https://pezblog.vercel.app/signup). Claim the short usernames while they're still available! You can login using a simple username/password (no unnecessary integrations needed). Logging in with email also works.

### Writing an entry
Not really much to it. Add a title (can be something as simple as "journal #1" if you're not feeling creative) and some content and add the entry. Entries will always be sorted on the dashboard in reverse chronological order (most recent first).
